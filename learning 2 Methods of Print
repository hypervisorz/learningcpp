#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "PRINT AND PRINT" << std::endl;
	std::cout << "or i could type slash n ";
	std::cin.get();
}

// and then there is

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "PRINT AND PRINT" << std::endl;
	cout << "or i could type slash n ";
	return 0;
}

  // which is faster but for some reason some weird text come at bottom mentioning files or something. 
  // when i use std:: it doesnt do that.. weird.
